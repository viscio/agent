** HOW TO RUN:

Inside the "src" folder, in a shell, run "python -m teams_agent.app". In another shell, run "teamsapptester start". This last command should open a new browser window with the Teams testing platform, and there there should be the instructions. 

NOTE: There is no commercial LLM usage since I do not have any paid plan for this. I am using a local LLM provided by my institution.
